# This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Actions

name: CI

# Controls when the workflow will run
on:
  # Triggers the workflow on push or pull request events but only for the "main" branch
  push:
    branches: [ "main" ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ "main" ]

  # Allows you to run this workflow manually from the Actions tab
  workflow_dispatch:

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  # This workflow contains a single job called "build"
  build:
    # The type of runner that the job will run on
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
    steps:
      # Checks-out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your job can access it
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3

      # Runs a single command using the runners shell
      - name: Run a one-line script
        run: echo Hello, world!

      # Runs a set of commands using the runners shell
      - name: Run a multi-line script
        run: |
          echo Add other actions to build,
          echo test, and deploy your project.

Generates one file per line. Each output can be customized with query string.
following this pattern: path/to/file.<gif or svg>?palette=<github or github-dark>&color_snake=<color>&color_dots=<color>,<color>,<color>,<color>,<color>

supported query string options:

- palette: a preset of color, one of [github, github-dark, github-light]
- color_snake: color of the snake
- color_dots: coma separated list of dots color. The first one is the empty cell color, the second one is the lightest shade, the third one is the second lightest shade ect ...

example:
  outputs: |
    dark.svg?palette=github-dark&color_snake=blue
    light.svg?color_snake=#7845ab
    ocean.gif?color_snake=orange&color_dots=#bfd6f6,#8dbdff,#64a1f4,#4b91f1,#3c7dd9

    outputs: # optional
